Ferret [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WASdev/sample.ferret.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WASdev/sample.ferret)
======

This sample project contains a simple Servlet application called Ferret. Ferret listens for HTTP requests sent to `<host>:<port>/ferret[/*]`, and responds with information about the request and the server. This is a simplified fork of [https://github.com/WASdev/sample.ferret](https://github.com/WASdev/sample.ferret) to test S2I deployments. It differs from the orgignal as follows:

1. Maven only build that creates a **.war** file but does not use the Liberty Maven plugin to create a Liberty server instance
2. Copied *server.xml* to the newly created folder **wlp/config** to accommodate multi-module apps.

## Running in Eclipse

### Maven
1. Download and install [Eclipse with the WebSphere Developer Tools](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/liberty-profile-using-eclipse/).
2. Create a new Liberty Profile Server. See [step 3](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/liberty-profile-using-eclipse/) for details.
3. Clone this repository.
4. Import the sample into Eclipse using *File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects* option.
5. Deploy the sample into Liberty server. Right click on the *ferret* sample and select *Run As -> Run on Server* option. Find and select a  Liberty profile server and press *Finish*.
6. Go to: [http://localhost:9080/ferret][]


## Running in the Command Line

### Maven cmd-line
This project can be built with [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/).

Use the following steps to build the application with Maven:

1. Execute the full Maven build. The Liberty Maven Plug-in will download and install the Liberty server.
    ```bash
    $ mvn clean package
    ```

2. Deploy the generated **.war** file and **server.xml** to a Liberty server instance


Once the app is running, the application will be available under [http://localhost:9080/ferret][].
